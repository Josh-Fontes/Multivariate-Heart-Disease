# Multivariate-Heart-Disease
A group paper that explores utilizing different multivariate statistical techniques to examine different facets of heart disease.  The goal was to learn more about multivariate statistical analysis while examining interesting questions about heart disease.  The statistical software R was used for all statistical analyses.

The full report can be found/read in the pdf file uploaded above (still working on it).  I have also uploaded the code used in the analysis in a R file.
